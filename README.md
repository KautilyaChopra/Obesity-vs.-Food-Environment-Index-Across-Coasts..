# Obesity-vs.-Food-Environment-Index-Across-Coasts

**Purpose:** 
This repository was created for the Unit 3 final project fo Professor Steven Gotzler's Spring 2025 English 105 class at UNC Chapel Hill.

**Contains:** 
This repository contains a csv file of raw public health data that was analyzed, this file can be found under the data folder. A csv file that specifically contains obesity and health environment data in regards to comparing California and North Carolina, this can be found under the data folder. And finally a Python notebook named feeder_3_1-2.ipnyb that contains detailed intructions for cradfting the subset final product from the orignal data set. 

**Potential Purpose:** 
Analyzing data related to obesity and access to nutrition in North Carolina and California could identify relationships between geographic, economic, and cultural factors that affect public health challenges accross the nation. This analysis can be further used in the future to target specific areas on both the east and west coasts that need interventions and reform in regards to creating a healthier food enviornmment to reduce obesity. The examination of the correlation between the healthy food indexes and obesity rates across the two states could also unveil how much effort the states are putting into implementing policies to create a healthier tomorrow.

**Potential Applications:**
Some potential applications of this data analyzations include public health policy design and evaluation, identification of food deserts and underserved communities, healthcare resource allocation and preventive care programs, and support for nonprofit initiatives focused on food security and obesity prevention.

**Where to Begin:** 
Users can begin in the data folder where first the raw data can be observed, then they can make their way to the CAplusNC csv file in this folder to view the analyzed subset of this data, and finally they can view feeder_3_1-2.ipnyb file to see all the steps that went into the analyzation process, graphs that correspond to the data, and instructions to prossibly reproduce the project.

**Acknowlegements:** 
This repository is currently maintained by Kautilya Chopra who is a current freshman Computer Science major at UNC Chapel Hill. The raw data used in this repository was provided by his English 105 proffesor, Dr. Steven Gotzler.
